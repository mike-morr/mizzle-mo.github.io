```
[<Literal>]
let Three = 3

let filter123 x =
    match x with
    // The following line contains literal patterns combined with an OR pattern.
    | 1 | 2 | Three -> printfn "Found 1, 2, or 3!"
    // The following line contains a variable pattern.
    | var1 -> printfn "%d" var1

for x in 1..10 do filter123 x
